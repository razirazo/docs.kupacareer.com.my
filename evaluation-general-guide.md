# General Marking Guidelines

## Introduction: Evidence Based Evaluation

In our previous events, the evaluations are generally based on relative panel perception. There were many inherent flaw in this evaluation system, which the biggest is where the panels are prone to [non-impartial judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) as direct result of personal opinion and subjectivity.

Going forward, we are a making major change by adopting evidence based evaluation to address many issues with old system.

In this system, instead of panels giving out marks at his/her discretionary basis, each questions will be supplied with a list of objectives or evidences to watch for. For each objective met, a point is given up to maximum cumulative of four for each subsection.

## Questionnaire structure and points allocations

Questions will be divided by sections, and each sections contains subsections to be evaluated. 

Each subsections are accompanied by a list of objectives or evidences to watch for. Each objectives or evidences is accompanied by value of the point.

For example:

> ### 1a. Resume Formatting
> ### Technical Format 
In a modern world where documents are read and sorted by computer and AI, proper formatting is important. In this section, we will observe if the resume is automation friendly.
>> * **`1`** Font: Arial or Times New Roman
>> * **`1`** Font Size: 12 (just estimate, if it doesn't look wrong that its all good)
>> * **`0.5`** Structure
>> * **`-1`** More than 3 accent colors
>> * **`-1`** Wrong filename template
>> * **`-10`** Scanned document
> 

If the letter is written in Arial font with 12 size, has correct structure, the net point is **3.5**. 

Since the form will not accept decimals, points should be rounded to lower boundary. So **3.5** points will be considered as **3** points.

Minimum and maximum possible points are 1 and 4 respectively. If a candidate gained for example, **6** points, then put **4** points in the form. The same applies to minimum. If a candidate messed up so bad that it net to even **-10** points, please put it as **1** point in the form.


Some subsections that are focusing on finding candidate's faults are evaluated by primarily point deduction mechanism. For this kind of questions, there will be 4 initial points given by default, indicated with "**`4`** Initial points" as first item on the list.
