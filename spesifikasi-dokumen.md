Unless specified otherwise, **PDF** is the sole document format recognized by the committee. All PDF documents must be generated directly from Microsoft Word. We will not accept PDF containing screenshot or scan of handwritten documents.

## Paper Size
Paper size follows Malaysian Standards, which is **A4** (210 x 297 mm). Please ensure that you are not using another popular size which is US Letter size (215.9 x 279.4 mm) which looks dimensionally similar.

!> Computers with improperly configured locale tends to default to US Letter size.

## Number of Pages
While this is not a strict requirement in real-world scenario, we limit Cover Letter and Resume submission in this event to **one page each**. 

## Filename
Use this template:  

```
<Your assigned number> - <FULL NAME>.pdf
```

So if your name is `Muhammad Firdaus Bin Ihwaan` with assigned number of `S030`, your uploaded document name would look like this:

?> **S030 - MUHAMMAD FIRDAUS BIN IHWAAN**

Capitalization of .pdf extension doesn't matter. It can be .pdf or .PDF.

## Document size
**Maximum allowed upload size is 1MB.** However, a properly written document would typically produce a size less then 200KB each.
