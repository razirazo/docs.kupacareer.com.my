## Perks of Physical Attendance

## Limits of Online Panels Intake
Unlike Physical Panel slot that are always open, Online Panels slot are limited, and offered on first-come-first-serve basis. In case of the slot is full, we will offer you Physical slot which you may accept or reject. Unless more slot is opened on Program Director's approval, we sadly have to consider your registration cancelled if you opted to reject the offer.
