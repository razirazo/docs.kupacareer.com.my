## Writing tips
### Make it easy to read by following the common standards
Use professional letter fonts like Arial or Times New Roman set in 12-font size. Set the margin to 2.5cm (1.0 inch) or 3.8cm (1.5 inch) depending on the length of your letter. Make sure your cover letter looks full but not stuffed with words.
### Address the scholarship body by name
When addressing your cover letter, don’t write “To Whom It May Concern” or “Dear Sir/Madam.” Instead, use the scholarship issuer's name, and address your cover letter to them directly. 
### Use a standard sign-off like “Regards” or “Sincerely”
Finish your cover letter with any of the following polite and professional salutations:
* Sincerely
* Best
* Regards
* Thank you
* Respectfully
* Kind regards
* Best regards
