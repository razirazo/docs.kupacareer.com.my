## Do This 
### Keep your resume clear and concise
An interviewer takes an average of 30 seconds to skim a resume. You want them to see right away that you are qualified for the scholarship.
### Proofread your resume numerous times
Be sure there are no spelling or grammar mistakes. Have someone else read it over as well. A simple spelling mistake on a resume can give a negative impression to the interviewer. It can even prevent you from getting the scholarship.
### Tailor your resume to suit your application
Specify experience or achievements that are related to the objective of your interview. For this scholarship interview, put emphasis on <...>.
### Be honest
Lying on your resume is never a good idea. You don't want to overstate your skills or results as it will mislead the interviewer. Have confidence in what you have to offer.
### Quantify your achievements
Use firm numbers that the employer will understand and be impressed by. For example, how many people you supervised, how many products you sold, by what percentage you increased sales, etc.
### Double check your contact information
Your contact information information should be placed at the top of your resume. Make sure this information is accurate. Otherwise, the interviewer won't be able to contact you.


## Don't do This 
### Don't use an inappropriate email address
Make sure your email is easy to read, easy to type, professional and non offensive. In general, your email address should be based on your name. Ideally, you will want to exclude any nicknames, numbers, or special characters.
### Don't include unnecessary personal information
It is best to leave out any personal details such as age, weight, height, religious preference, political views, or any other personal attributes that could be controversial. This will prevent any potential bias. Most importantly, never include your IC number in your resume.
### Don't use too many bullets
Make your resume easy to read by limiting each resume section or sub section to very few bullet points. Each bullet point comes with readability cost, thus should be used wisely.
### Don't include references unless requested
An interviewer only requires references if they are seriously considering accepting you. Keep references on a separate sheet and provide them only when they are specifically requested. In this Mock Interview context, references will not be requested.
